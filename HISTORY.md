## 0.0.0-0 B Renaming project from "opm" to "Rsms-project"

RSMS project, where RSMS stands for: '*Relational Sofware Management System*' (as distinguished from a traditional, flat-file Software Management System), obviously is a more declarative and self-explaining name then: '*OPM*' (Object Process Model). Changed this throughout documentation. OPM as a abrevatiation for Object Process Model is kept to describe the core concept of RSMS, the Object/Process build model.

## 0.0.0-0 A Initial commit

Just the project preliminary description and documentation, no source code yet.
