# OPM-is-NOT-IP

The documentation about *Intentional Programming*, provided in this repository ([Birth of IP](birth_of_IP.pdf)) is only added 
to provide some background on a similar system with similar design goals, but does not imply in any way that **OPM** is some sort of re-implementation of **IP**, nor has the same design goals, nor aims for a similar or equivalent implementation.

*OPM* is clearly not intended to be a re-implementation of *Intentional Programming* and it has design goals and implementation details that set it apart from the implementation of *Intentional Programming*.

The only basic common principle for OPM and IP is that both apply the principles of relational design (renormalization) to software development.

The way in which that principe gets implemented in OPM is 

a. Not entirely fixed yet

and 

b. Will significantly differ from the way IP has implemented it.

c. We have no detailed knowledge about the implementation of IP

Since the implementation of IP (in the form of DSL's) is not an open/public implementation (except for the few public papers and articles that were published).

Basically this means that in-sofar OPM and IP share features and functionality, the only reason for that is because both rely on a common basic principle, but apart from that any other similarity in features and functionality is pure chance and *not* intentional (pun intended)....
