# OPM-is-NOT-IP

The documentation about Intentional programming, provided in this repository ([Birth of IP](birth_of_IP.pdf)) is only added 
to provide some background on a similar system with similar design goals, but does not imply in any way that OPM is some sort of 
re-implementation of IP, has the same design goals, and aims for a similar implementation.

OPM is clearly not intended to be a re-implementation of Intentional Programming and it has design goals and implementation details 
that set it apart from the implementation of Intentional Programming.

The only basic common principle for OPM and IP is that both apply the principles of relational design (renormalization) to software development.
The way in which that principe gets implemented in OPM is 

a. Not entirely fixed yet

and 

b. Will significantly differ from the way IP has implemented it.

Since the implementation of IP (in the form of DSL's) is not an open/public implementation 

c. We have no detailed knowledge about the implementation of IP

except for the few public papers and articles that were published.
