# OPM is not IP

The documentation about Intentional programming, provided in this repository ([Birth of IP](birth_of_IP.pdf)) is only added 
to provide some background on a similar system with similar design goals, but does not imply in any way that OPM is some sort of 
re-implementation of IP, has the same design goals, and aims for a similar implementation.

OPM is clearly not intended to be a re-implementation of Intentional Programming and it has design goals and implementation details 
that set it apart from the implementation of Intentional Programming.
